* [TNTP](https://github.com/bstabler/TransportationNetworks): The famous TNTP data. Most useful for studing network equilibrium problems. Includes Sioux Falls, Annaheim, Barcelona, Chicago, and many more.

* [Hazmat](https://github.com/STOM-Group/Hazmat-Network-Data): Buffalo, NY and Albany, NY. Originally used to study routing problems in hazardous materials transportation. Includes accident probabilities and consequences.
* [Korean Expressway](https://github.com/STOM-Group/KoreanExpressway): Originally used to study EV charging station location problems. Includes OD flow.
* [DC-NY-Bos](https://github.com/STOM-Group/DC-NY-BOS-Network-Data): Washington DC - New York City - Boston. Originally used to study EV charging station location problems. Includes population as travel demand.
* [Eastern Massachusetts](https://github.com/jingzbu/InverseVIsTraffic): Originally used to study inverse VI problems in traffic assignment. Includes observed traffic counts.
* [Pisa OR Group](http://www.di.unipi.it/optimize/Data/index.html): Data for Min Cost Flow problems, Location-Routing problems, Capacitated Facility Location problems, and Asymmetric Network Equilibrium problems.
